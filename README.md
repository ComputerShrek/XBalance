# XBalance
This is a simple code which  you should help maintain and build. It just brute-forces random gift codes.
It does not try them out, as that would be illegal. This is just a fun side project.
If you build a Snippet that tries out the code and uses it, it would be unlawful.
Even though it would be inefficient and probably not able to brute-force a single code.
# How to Use XBalance
## Installing the Requirements
To install everything on your Linux Machine:

**bash install.sh**

This should work on most Linux machines. It certainly will work with all distributions using the apt and dnf package managers. 
## How to run XBalance
