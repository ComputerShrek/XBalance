# XBalance
This is a simple code which  you should help maintain and build. It just brute-forces random gift codes.
It does not try them out, as that would be illegal. This is just a fun side project.
If you build a Snippet that tries out the code and uses it, it would be unlawful.
Even though it would be inefficient and probably not able to brute-force a single code.
