# XBalance
This is a simple code which  you should help maintain and build. It just bruteforces random gift codes.
It does not try them out, as that would be illegal. This is just a fun side project.
If you build a Snippet that trys the codes out, and use it it would be illegal.
Eventhough it would be inefficient and probably not able to bruteforce a single code.
